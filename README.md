# SmoothDeconvolutionNMR
This repository contains the main functionalities to resolve peaks in NMR relaxation experiments uing the smooth deconvolution approach of Frasso and Eilers (2023).
The main computations are performed in `fit_smooth_deconvolution()` part of `support_functions_nmr.R`.

The repository also contains the potato tubers data preesented in Hansen, C. L., Thybo, A. K., Bertram, H. C., Viereck, N., van den Berg, F., and Engelsen, S. B. (2010). 
Determination of dry matter content in potato tubers by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR). _Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry_, 58(19), 10300â€“10304.

Running the `example.R` file it is possible to reproduce Figure 2 of the reference.
A package is under contruction. In the meantime, please contact me for questions and issues.
